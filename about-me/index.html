                        <p>I'm learning English; nearly held back a grade for slow language development, I now understand that it was not my classmates that were stupid, but it was I who simply lacked the understanding to communicate with them.</p>

                        <p>I spend the majority of my childhood in the food court my parents worked in. Often cashiering by mental math to expedite service, my arithmetic matures and my interest in math beyond that of a tool sparks. In working with my parents and their coworkers, I'm pushed to grasp the concept of socioeconomic inequality and the rare American childhood it provided me.</p>

I purchase Red Alert 2 and spend my weekends climbing the global leaderboards. It was then that my curiosity of technology and love of games began (needless to say, I evolved to the Protoss race shortly after).</p>

                        <p>My friend (mentioned above) invites me to a youth ministry group at his church. The people there were nicer than most I thought. One even bought me a King James Bible for my scholarly benefit.</p>

                        <p>Well...I got kinda caught up in this autobiography of mine and maybe went a little overboard. Funny story, I actually grew up learning to talk about myself in the third person in Chinese. Not sure why, but it's stuck with me to this day and feels totally natural. Perhaps it's my inner personality showing through a bit.</p>

                        <p>Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read this behemoth of a page. Feel free to leave feedback on the <a href="/contact/">contact page</a>.
